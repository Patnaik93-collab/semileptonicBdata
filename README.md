In this work we compute the branching fraction of $B \to D^{(*)} \,\tau \, \nu_{\tau}$ and $B_s \to D_s^{(*)}\, \tau\, \nu_{\tau}$ 
within the Relativistic Independent Quark Model, emphasizing the QCD-inspired model-dependent analysis of these decay channels in the 
precision flavor physics era. Considering the experimental observation of longitudinal $\tau$-polarization and fraction of longitudinal polarization 
at LHCb and Belle, we have also investigated these observables within our model framework which are aligning well with the standard model expectations.
We perform a comprehensive analysis of the form factors across the whole accessible kinematic range of $q^2$. Our results are consistent and compatible
with other theoretical approaches as well as with the experimental measurements. The data have been respectively shared for the decay channels. 
Furthermore, we evaluated the clean ratios of $B_s$ to $B_0$ in the semimuonic mode that are in accordance with the LHCb measurements, 
and support the validity of the SU(3) flavor symmetry. Although Lattice study being the gold standard for the decay channels, however in the abasence of
lattice data for various channels, our model predictions will be benefical for comparison.
